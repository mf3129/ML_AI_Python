We passed some features to our model, some math was done, an answer was returned. The data was not changed or transformed throughout this process. A neural network processes our data differently. It attempts to represent our data in different ways and in different dimensions by applying specific operations to transform our data at each layer. Another way to express this is that at each layer our data is transformed in order to learn more about it. By performing these transformations, the model can better understand our data and therefore provide a better prediction.**\n",

Each layer also has something called a bias, this is simply an extra neuron that has no connections and holds a single numeric value. Data starts at the input layer and is trasnformed as it passes through subsequent layers.** The data at each subsequent neuron is defined as the following.\n",
